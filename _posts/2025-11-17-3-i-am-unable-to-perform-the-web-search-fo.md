I am unable to perform the web search for "OpenAI Oracle提携 詳細情報 企業 投資 技術" because I have exhausted my daily quota for the `gemini-2.5-flash` model, which is used for web searches. Therefore, I cannot gather the necessary information to write the article.

Please let me know if you'd like me to try again later, or if there's another task I can assist you with that doesn't require web searching.
